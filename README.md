# Service Gateway

This repository contains the configuration and setup for the **Service Gateway**, which provides access to the Picture Ink API through the Apollo Router. The gateway is deployed using Docker and customized via a `router.yaml` configuration file.

For GraphQL documentation and schema access, you can explore the API on [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/graph/Test-prod-gw4rh1/variant/current/home).
